# Supernova Explosion in Turbulent Interstellar medium in galaxies

**One line description of the data:**
Blastwave in a dense cool gas cloud.

**Longer description of the data:**
The simulations solve an explosion inside a compression of a monatomic ideal gas, which follows the equation of state with the specific heat ratio $\gamma=5/3$.
The gas in these simulations mocks the interstellar medium in the Milky Way Galaxy.
At the beginning of the simulations, the thermal energy of a supernova is dumped at the center of the simulation box.
The hot ($\sim 10^7$ K) gas is immediately accelerated and makes the blastwave.
Because velocities of the hot gas become supersonic, much fine resolution and small timestep are required to resolve the dynamics.
The physical quantities are also distributed in seven orders of magnitude, which requires a large number of simulation steps.

**Equation**:

$$
\begin{align*}
P&=(\gamma-1) \rho u \\
\frac{d \rho}{dt} &= -\rho \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v} \\
\frac{d^2 \boldsymbol{r}}{dt^2}  &= -\frac{\nabla P}{\rho} + \boldsymbol{a}_{\rm visc}-\nabla \Phi \\
\frac{d u}{dt} &= -\frac{P}{\rho} \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{v} + \frac{\Gamma-\Lambda}{\rho}
\end{align*}
$$

where $P$, $\rho$, and $u$ are the pressure. $r$ is the position, $a_{\rm visc}$ is the acceleration generated by the viscosity, $\Phi$ is the gravitational potential, $\Gamma$ is the radiative heat influx per unit volume, and $\Lambda$ is the radiative heat outflux per unit volume.

## What is interesting and challenging about the data:

**What phenomena of physical interest are catpured in the data:**
The simulations are designed as an supernova explosion, which is the explosion at the last moment of massive stars, in a high-density starforming molecular cloud with a large density contrast. An adiabatic compression of a monatomic ideal gas is assumed.
To mimic the explosion, the huge thermal energy ($10^{51}$ erg) is injected at the center of the calculation box and going to make the blastwave, which sweeps out the ambient gas and shells called as supernova feedback. These interactions between supernovae and surrounding gas are interesting because stars are formed in dense and cold regions.

However, calclatig the propagation of blastwaves requires tiny timesteps to calculate and numerous integration steps. When supernova feedback is incorporated in a galaxy simulation, some functions fitted using local high resolution simulations have been used.

**How to evaluate a new simulator operating in this space:**
In context of galaxy simulations, the time evolution of thermal energy and momentum are important. We note that those physical quantities are not necessarily conserved because radiative cooling and heating are considered and thermal energy is seamlessly being converted into momentum.
